Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 Bioconductor package, we performed differential expression analysis (DEA) to identify differential expressed genes (DEGs) in plasma and leukocyte samples from GSE157103 dataset and differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in lung cancer cell linesfrom GSE148729 dataset.
